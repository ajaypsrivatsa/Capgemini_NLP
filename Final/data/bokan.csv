0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,2,This place has potential but it has one the most unwelcoming entrances when you come in from the outside. An unmanned dimly lit entrance. A lift up. Then nobody to help you to a seat or guide you and it even felt painful trying to get service once we sat at a table.,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d17415315-r780355376-BOKAN_38_Bar_39_Rooftop-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

3,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,5,"Terrific view, service & atmosphere. The restaurant (one floor lower) was fully booked - unsurprisingly for a Saturday evening - but the bar above has the same views. The service from Athina was great, really friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. The bar menu is obviously more limited than the restaurant but still reasonable . The charcuterie platter was good, fish & chips likewise, burger excellent. A really nice evening. We will be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d17415315-r779128888-BOKAN_38_Bar_39_Rooftop-London_England.html,Tripadvisor
4,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,2,"I am coming very often at Bokan with my friends and always had a great experience, nice cocktails and friendly staff. However yesterday evening we did face a different attitude from the bartender Martina which was very rude to us and did not prepare the cocktail that we have asked and when we asked her for the cocktail that we wanted she started to argue saying that this is the cocktail and even start to laugh with her colleague and talking about us. I was shocked that at Bokan they still have people with this kind of attitude that don’t even bother about the guest requests. Very unprofessional. Really hope the management will take further actions.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d17415315-r745371622-BOKAN_38_Bar_39_Rooftop-London_England.html,Tripadvisor
5,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,5,"I was reccomended this venue by a waiter in another restaurant, I was skeptic upon reading the reviews but I decided why not to give it a shot. I don't understand the negative reviews! The place gets pretty crowded but that's normal when the view and the cocktails are so great! I didn't have any food but upon prying from other tables it looked great. I guess I will have to go back for that :)",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d17415315-r728349677-BOKAN_38_Bar_39_Rooftop-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

10,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,5,"This was my first time visiting the Bokan having seen/heard many positive comments. My initial perception of the place was that it seemed very cool and modern which was followed by a vibrant atmosphere. I was lucky enough to find a window table which showcased just how amazing London is and how the Bokan Bar rooftop bar is truly a picturesque setting. The staff were friendly, in particular a guy named Breno who was highly attentive and provided a personable service. We were one of, if not the last persons to leave the bar and he ensured our glass was always full until the minute we left. Thanks Breno for your fantastic service and thank you Bokan for offering such a fantastic place to enjoy drinks in London. I will be returning. 100% recommended. My only feedback would be to extend opening hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d17415315-r731906126-BOKAN_38_Bar_39_Rooftop-London_England.html,Tripadvisor
11,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,2,We visited the bar in December 2019. Waiting for a long time to be seated. Very nice views of London. Staff tends to ignore you.

12,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,3,Stayed in Novotel. Used Boken bar on 38th floor and rooftop. £9.50 for glass of Prosseco and £3 for bottle of Coke plus 12.5% service charge even if you order at the bar ! Open to non residents. Worth going once (sunset) to catch the views over London. Restaurant and food not used.

13,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,2,"This wasn’t my first time at Bokan’s but this time was disappointing. Apart from the warm greeting by Constantine at our arrival and the spectacular views of London, the service, especially from one waitress was poor. It took a long time to order, she did not smile once and after ordering four drinks and four dishes, she presented the bill which already included 12.50% service charge demanding we pay it in full before taking one sip and well before receiving our food! If this is the bar’s policy (very peculiar to pay for food and service before even receiving it!), you should inform customers and explain it in a professional and friendly manner. The food wasn’t even that great. Only worth the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d17415315-r708611677-BOKAN_38_Bar_39_Rooftop-London_England.html,Tripadvisor
14,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,4,I guess the main reason for visiting Bokan if you are not staying at the hotel is the spectacular view across the city. That is the reason we went for drinks here and it was very pleasant. It was busy and therefore service at the bar was slow but you do not come here if you are in a hurry so no problem. £10 for two bottles of Peroni seemed reasonable in the circumstances and we enjoyed our drinks and the amazing view.,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d17415315-r703074122-BOKAN_38_Bar_39_Rooftop-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

17,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,3,"Went after work last few for couple of drinks - didn't realise until end of the evening a 12.5% service charge was added to every round or drinks that WE ordered at the bar. Then WE took back to our seats?? Can't understand why that was - service is for ""service"" not for someone doing their job/making drinks?? It does not say this anywhere until you have actually paid for your drinks and then it is on the receipt.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d17415315-r715183063-BOKAN_38_Bar_39_Rooftop-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

31,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,5,"Stunning views from both inside and out. Busy and difficult to get a seat, and definitely not cheap.

71,Bokan 37 Restaurant,2,"Yes the views are amazing, yes the cocktails are good but these mean nothing if the service does not live up to the expectations. Their booking policy for the terrace appears to be simply untruthful and misleading. It's understandable that during good weather it will be busy. What is unacceptable is when you ask them to book they say that the system is blocked. Even if you say that you will call later they say that you cannot book and that you will have to walk in early. You walk in early and surprise surprise, everything is already booked for the day! So basically they will not tell you that they are fully booked and you're lured in by the hope that there will be availability.

83,Bokan 37 Restaurant,3,"I was staying in the hotel so reception kindly booked me a table. I stated I had food intolerances upon booking and this was noted. I was greeted and shown to a table and although initially service was attentive I was not given guidance on allergens in the menu and I had to try ordering a few options until I got one I could have. I would have expected the waiter to be more clued up on allergens and to be more helpful. It’s not like it’s a cheap restaurant. When my steak came the meat was cooked medium rare as requested but it wasn’t a good piece of meat and was quite chewy. I’m from a farming family so I know good steak and that wasn’t the quality I’d expect at a restaurant of this calibre. Something had been excluded from the dish due to my gluten intolerance but that had not been pointed out when I ordered. So, great that it was omitted however this should have been mentioned at the time of ordering. The “Amuse Bouche” was just brought to me and I had to request the waiter check the ingredients before I had it - again disappointing. I actually felt like I was a pain to the servers because of my allergies and other tables seemed to get more attentive service as I was sat there with an empty glass for ages and being ignored. All in all, great views, nice wine list but below par steak and below par service - specifically around allergens.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r565330501-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

Then we was seated in the bar area at a table that was practically on the floor. I asked to be moved to a table where we wouldnt have to eat with our food on our laps. He then gave us a bar menu. We asked if we could have the brunch menu which we booked for. He said this was downstairs but the brunch was now over. I advised I had checked online and that I was sure the last SEATING for brunch was 2pm and it started at 12. However it get very confusing as he couldn't really understand what we was saying either. We were just about to leave when we checked to say are you sure we cannot have a table and he said that we could but we had to order as the kitchen takes the last orders for brunch at 2:30pm.

Firstly, the staff could not be more friendly and were superb in tending to the table. Secondly, the restaurant offers exceptional views which give The Shard and Heron Tower a run for their money! Finally, the food was exquisite - not only is the presentation a wow factor (every course was Insta-worthy!), but it was delicious, fresh and cooked to perfection. I would say given the quality, it is very good value for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r562125261-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

The bonus was the live Jazz band at 4pm. (which plays until 7pm) They do an offer for £49.00 which includes as much Prosecco as you can drink from 2pm till 4pm. And to be fair, the waiters do not stop pouring it! Which is nice. They also serve water and ice at the table without charge. One of our group does not drink so she was given an option to choose a Mock-tail instead. Overall the food was tastey and very satisfying. There was my pet hate of the discretionary 12.5% service charge but we didn't mind paying it because the service was very good.

125,Bokan 37 Restaurant,1,We booked Bokan as we had visited previously and thought the place had a wow factor. We had our nephew and niece visiting from Switzerland and wanted to share a special evening with them. The evening was ruined by the woman at the front desk (Julia?) who is quite frankly the rudest person we have ever had the misfortune to encounter in any restaurant. Despite having received an email confirming our booking she kept us standing in the corridor for 10 mins and kept insisting that we did not have a booking!! I even showed her the email. She was disingenuous and disinterested. In the end I asked to see her booking screen and was able to locate the booking immediately. She had no sense of how much embarrassment and upset she was causing to us all. She didn’t even apologise for her error. Atrocious level of service from her.,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r542276462-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

The awful din emitted by a woman squealing into a microphone (they tell me that it is singing; but it has nothing in common with Covent Garden) was so loud because, apparently, it has to carry over three floors in the building.

It certainly didn't disappoint. Our table was booked for 7.15pm and we were promptly walked to out table. A cloudy day, and what could have dampened the view , soon changed to sun streaming through the cloud to highlight The Shaard and Millenium Wheel, sites we were able to see from our seats at the window table. Although the table had a 2 hour rebooking slot, something made clear in the booking, we were not made to feel as though we had to rush off or that someone was waiting for the table. As for the food. Well this has to be some of the best I have tasted in a while. From the 'amuse-Boucher ' to the main course of fillet steak, all tasted amazing. Will definitely be going back. Will have to just make up a special occasion to justify the visit. The icing on the proverbial cake has to be the roof terrace. The views from here, once evening had taken hold, were amazing.

Initially requesting us to sit in the most empty space with no padded seating even though we'd had a reservation. Soon after a hostess places us amongst a group of others. The service was that slow that my husband ended up going to the bar himself which again was a completely disorganised. Whilst he was getting the drinks, I was asked to move as the table I was told to sit at was also booked. At this point, I was pretty mad and my husband and I left shortly after our first drink. Wouldn't return and they really need to sort their booking system / customer service out! I'd dread to think what the restaurant would be like!!",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r471586430-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

Very impressive views out over Canary Wharf, the interior has been well designed and the view from the men's loos is something else (we all made a point of going for a look). However we waited an hour for our starters to arrive and thought they were nice it wasn't worth an hour's wait. The chef clearly was struggling and sent an amouse bouche to keep us occupied but we had to ask for bread which should have come as standard. The mains were nice but I was certainly not going to leave feeling stuffed. Slight style over substance and for the price I would expect more of a complete plate of food. We were there not long after opening so it may have been a glitch, it was only half full so they would not have coped with a full service.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r480252443-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

One of the bartenders kept arguing with the waitresses (one of them even started to cry, everything in front of the guests), and he tried to apologise by offering us the second round of drinks.

We ordered a cheese platter to start, and waited almost an hour and half for this to arrive. We were however given a plate of calamari by way of apology, but we noticed that the only reason for this, was because they had ordered it by mistake, and didn't know what to do with it.

We all moved downstairs to our table. As there were so many of us, we sent our meal choices in advance. The waiter confirmed with us and noted who was having what. When the food came, everyone was served at the same time. The starters were magnificent, such intense and amazing flavours. When the main course came none of us were disappointed. The steak, fish and chicken dishes were cooked to perfection and accompanied with eye catching purées and foams that were packed with complimentary flavours. The wine was great, also full of flavour but not overbearing - just right! It seemed a shame to stop at the main course...the puddings and cheeses matched the quality and flavours we had already experienced and the sommelier picked us a wonderful wine to finish. Our waiter did a fantastic job and saw to all our every need.

My friend accidentally knocked a drink over, and within 2 minutes the manager came over and said that security was watching us and to calm down. (Knocking the drink over may have been coincidence). We were having a great time before this and would have easily stayed in there until closing, and spent a lot more money, but this made us want to leave straight away. The gentlemen could have come over to make sure we was good if he had a concern, or seen if we needed anything, but it felt like because security said something to him, he came over as the man, and told us to calm down. It put us off and I don't think we will be going back. There are enough rooftop bars in London, which are cheaper as well, and you won't get accused of anything either.

I would definitely stay there again and recommend it for sure. The only ""negative"" comment I had read about the hotel was the very slow service at the bar or the restaurant. OMG, beyond SLOW.......staff walked by me and totally ignored me and my friend. I even stood at the bar wanting a glass of wine, was standing right in front of the bartender who was YES I KNOW very busy, but he could have at least acknowledge my presence......It took for ever to get a glass of wine, and than had to ask for my check......Having said that the staff for the brunch if wonderful and if this obvious they are there to serve you and make sure your visit is as enjoyable as possible. Another comment, is that there doesn't seem to be enough tables on the 3 floors to accommodate the number of guests staying at the hotel. Also, there was NO information in the room for phone numbers such as room service, front desk, wakeup call, etc....and no visitor guide or magazine.

She said if we could find a table then we could sit at it but she didn't like the idea of 20 people and not sure why as we all have jobs and money! It took a man in our party to get a table for us and then she gave me dirty looks all night. The last straw was the prices advertised on the menu were not what we were charged. The prosecco was £10 more! Also they add 20% to your bill when you buy from the bar! Surely this is not legal!

Talk about incompetence. Yet they wanted a form filling in prior to attending which was done in great detail. Clearly they don't communicate with each other.

More importantly the cocktail menu is original and if you don't fancy any of it, the experienced bartenders can be creative around your taste buds. The oudoor space is fantastic spot, although you can imagine in high demand. So book a table in advance. Has become our regular since it's opening.

We was then approached by Julia who should not be working front of house and rudely said you cannot sit there even though there was no one else to take the table at the time truly disgusted with her attitude and really had put he of going to what is in theory my local bar I suggest Mondrian at London Bridge there rumpus room bar is a lot more better run with friendly staff.,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r493782764-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor
242,Bokan 37 Restaurant,1,"The bar lounge on level 39 has really lovely panoramic views. Unfortunetly, the service is dreadful. I have never come across such rude staff anywhere in London. My colleague's birthday drinks were totally ruined. The hostess on level 38 was abrupt with no customer skills. I was made feel unwelcome. Bar staff on level 39 were even worse. On several occasions when trying to buy a drink I was totally ignored. After waiting for some time I was told I had to queue somewhere else. No further details were given or explained to me. Buying a drink each time was such a challenge. Settling payments was another issue - each time different prices were applied for the same drink. A tall waiter kept coming to our area throughout the night reminding us how we should have booked a table, despite half of the reserved ones being empty. I don't understand why would you want to turn spending clients away when the place is half empty. The overall experience was very disappointing. As an employee based in Canary Wharf, I was very excited about the opening of this venue. I thought it would be great for team outings, Friday drinks, leaving parties, etc. There is no way I'm coming backing to Bokan and will not recommend to it to anyone in Canary Wharf. When you charge premium prices for food, drinks and service, you just have to do better than my last night's experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r495640082-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

The menu is not incredibly long but it does have to offer a great number of dishes, I would recommend the squid as an appetiser and the lamb or to be on the safe side: go for the rib eye steak, you cannot go wrong with it. The interior is fantastic with its large windows that provide you with a great view of London from above. I will definitely be coming back, especially for the bar, which offers a huge range of interesting non-classical cocktails.

The views from the Bar are really superb, having seen the views at 4.30pm, decided to stay all evening just to experience the night time views. We were certainly not disappointed, they are really really superb. As the bar has floor to ceiling windows, you get a spectacular view of central London. Luke who served us in the evening was also very nice and very friendly, he even made a bespoke cocktail for my friend. Jeevan who is the manager there came and checked on us often. To be fair we were there from 4.30pm - 1am, but even still it was very nice to be checked upon and so looked after by Jeevan. He also gave us a show around of the restaurant and the roof top bar. We will definitely return. The only small feedback would have is to change the olives in the bar, they really did not taste good, they were almost bitter. We had a great evening at Bokan and would definitely recommend to anyone to go there for a drink..friendly staff and amazing views guaranteed!!

Nelson the sommelier is an absolute star. I honestly can’t recall a better matched wine list for a tasting menu. And by Saturday night London standards it was fairly priced. What else?

When we asked for the cocktail list, it took forever to arrive, and the waiter could not explain the cocktails and had to get another member of the bar staff. The same happened with the wine menu. Likewise, the waiters were unable to explain certain items on the dinner menu, i.e. what they were or how they were prepared. Everything took an absolutely extraordinary amount of time to arrive. We had endless wait times between courses and long periods with empty drinks.

325,Bokan 37 Restaurant,4,"A week or so ago I booked a table at the restaurant on 37 and was hoping to have a drink on the roof terrace on 39 on this wonderful warm evening. Unfortunately for us the whole terrace had been booked for the evening so we had drinks on floor 38 instead. I had only found this out this morning when the receptionist called to confirm our reservation. This was mentioned on the website but I hadn’t thoroughly checked it. The guy on reception on 38 was very welcoming and perfect for front of house. The bar staff were very friendly and the guy that served our drinks at the table on 38 enjoyed conversation and a joke or two. As we were leaving to go to the restaurant I had half-jokingly asked him whether the tip we gave him included a quick sneak view of the party upstairs he became quite serious and said it was not possible. Maybe I read it wrongly but he seemed a little distant from that moment. At 7pm the restaurant had only 2-3 other tables booked and we were served quickly. Our waiter, Cristian, was a delight. Both the receptionist that called this morning and Cristian checked to see whether there were any allergies and also asked whether it was a special occasion. After choosing our mains and changing one meal there was a slight mix-up. This minor error with our meal choices would have been quickly corrected but we were happy to proceed as presented and the beef and duck choices were delicious as were the desserts. It was a slightly higher price than expected with a main, a side and a dessert each, with just one glass of wine at the table around £60 per head. To me the docklands area has a slightly distant ‘unreal’ feel to it and there was less interaction with other customers in this establishment than we usually find in The City and West End. This could well change depending on the night and could also be my own personal take on the vibe. I personally love the established feel about more historic areas in London.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r688789999-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

335,Bokan 37 Restaurant,3,"Bokan 37 is an expensive restaurant. So I expected the service to be top class too. However, it was very disjointed. On arrival, as a party of 4, we were not offered a drink but given the wine menu. So we selected a bottle of champagne. The waitress took our order for the champagne and the starters and main courses. She sent over the sommelier who recommended and left on the table a claret for the main course. We then waited for a while until the starters arrived whereby we had to chase up the champagne. When it finally arrived the waiter tried to take away the claret glasses until we retrieved them as we also had our claret, long before the champagne. Fortunately we had chosen cold starters. Then during the main course one of the waitresses leant right across the table to pour the jus rather than going around. The service continued rather haphazardly all evening.

Yes the service was a bit slow and took a while to get our orders but the view more than compensated for the delays. The staff were very accommodating and knowledgeable about the food. The menu offers an eclectic mix of dishes. The starters were adequate and the choices did not particularly excite but the main course of venison pie was outstanding. The dessert was even better. The ginger pudding was full of flavour and melted in the mouth. My fellow Diner commentated that it was the best dessert they had had in 20 years. I will be back in a month to see if the issues have been ironed out and then will give a more critical review.

346,Bokan 37 Restaurant,4,"We had booked for the soft launch period but we were unable to reserve in the restaurant so we were offered the bar. There was a warm welcome on arrival and we were taken to a high table in the bar. I asked the person who showed us to the table if the food came from the same kitchen in the bar and the restaurant but she said it was a better menu in the restaurant, which I expected. Then she said that they had had a cancellation in the restaurant so could move us to there, which we were very happy about. Our table was right next to the window and the view was fabulous. The decor inside the restaurant and bar is very industrial, with big windows really making the best of the view. The only issue we had was the music. It was kind of annoying and it would have been nice to have something a bit more mellow to enhance the sophisticated atmosphere. We selected a very nice bottle of portuguese red and looked at the menu. Some excellent bread was brought to the table. The menu wasn't huge but we both found things we wanted to try. For starter we shared the Bokan board which had a selection of charcuterie, cheese, pate and a scotch egg. The pate lacked a bit of flavour but the scotch egg was perfectly cooked with a runny centre. For main we had the pork belly and venison pie, both were very tasty. The desserts were also very good and beautifully presented, plus good coffee to finish. The service throughout was charming, friendly and helpful. Overall we had a lovely evening. The full price of the meal would be a little high but this is definitely a place to come for a special occasion.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r467983973-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

353,Bokan 37 Restaurant,3,"For about 2 years I've dinned at Bokan approximately 4 times a month and maybe even more. I even chose Bokan for Christmas lunch. I think I could be considered a good, if not a very loyal client. I have never pulled rank, never asked for special treatment and never got stressed out over the placement of the table. I have now planned a dinner for 6 at Bokan next month. For this one time I asked if I could reserve a table of my choice for this very special group of people to experience the restaurant. I was told very plainly and clearly ..... NO, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY! I was even told by one staff member that if I came 2 hours in advance of the dinner at 6pm I could then take the table of my choice because the place would be empty !!!! Now, I have been dining in the best restaurants in the world for about 60 years in fact long before any of the Bokan staff could even spell the word restaurant. The fact that for one time I'm not able to book a table of my choice proves several facts. 1. There is no restaurant / customer loyalty. 2. The management of the restaurant really has no idea what world class dining is about! 3. The customers of Bokan are merely a number and the place clearly caters to the transient diner with whom they need not establish a rapport or a relationship with. Considering this attitude of Bokan I will take my custom as well as my friends elsewhere. We will dine on the special evening mentioned at C. London (Cipriani) where I can book the table I feel comfortable at, where the table linens are as exquisite as the food and the white uniformed staff is smiling, courteous, and care about me ...... the customer. Goodbye Bokan. Your mediocre service will not take you far. By the way, The Ivy In The Park is also a wonderful restaurant that cares about their clients.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r743086109-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

Portions were very small (agree gourmet food has smaller portions but this was smaller than dishes served at the Dorchester, Oblix etc) and whilst they were presented well, the food was below average vs. similar restaurants and somewhat bland. Service was awful, food was served cold so some dishes were sent back and drinks took forever to serve. We ended up getting up to order from the bar itself.

We were shown to a table and were sat for probably about 15 minutes before our order (drink and food) was taken. Around 40 minutes later, we still hadn’t received our drinks, never mind the food. This was despite a couple who came in after us getting both food and drinks long before us. The waiters kept walking past and looking at the table and could clearly see we didn’t have any drinks yet, but did nothing about it. It wasn’t until I got the attention of a female member of staff, who looked to be in charge possibly and mentioned it to her that something started to be done. It was however, an hour, before we even got our drinks and then eventually our food came out. We were charged a £7.25 service charge, which seemed excessive seeing as it took so long to get anything to eat or drink. When the food arrived, it was ok but nothing special and certainly not worth the wait. I wouldn’t recommend this place, we certainly weren’t made to feel very welcome and nothing was offered as an apology for the poor service.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r709002464-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

397,Bokan 37 Restaurant,5,A wonderful gem near Canary Wharf in a Novotel. No really inside a Novotel. It is on a really high floor with fantastic panaromic views of London. Much more reasonable than the shard and great cocktails. We had a moijto and a rhubarb version. Pictures attached. Abt £12 each plus 12.5% service charge. The duty manager is crazy and funny. We asked could we sit on a reserved table by the window. He said let me check. Let’s call a friend like on who wants to be a millionaire. Then after a few funny comments gave us our table. We were served by a lovely Italian lady and service was great and almost endearing.

The menu is compact (I've been there 3 times in 3 months and the menu is the same). The chef favours undercooked fish, but will cook meat to your taste. The vegetarian options are tasty and include cheese, but I think a vegan may struggle to find something unless the restaurant is advised in advance.

If you ever visit this bar, do yourself a favor and have Liam serve you. The guy is a beast at his craft and made some of the best drinks I've had in my life.

423,Bokan 37 Restaurant,3,"I always visit Bokan because I am simply impressed with the views - they are stunning. We always walk-in and very kind reception ladies try to accommodate and find a table for you. 6 of us went to the restaurant a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time - bill was £500 but we had great food, amazing wine. However, let me tell one very important thing - bar team and waitress are always rude (not restaurant's). I never complained to any of the managers but I cannot hide it anymore. The last time I went there - we were 3 ladies and ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress brought 2 glasses only but and I kindly asked to get 1 more glass (obviously). We waited for 15 minutes but there was no one and still didnt get the glass. I went to the bar, no one paid any attention. Then I found the same waitress and again KINDLY asked to get an empty glass because we are 3. She was so arrogant and started to show her embarrassment by saying: ""I told you that I'm bringing it."" I cannot believe.. I said I cant wait any longer because it has been more than 15 minutes! Then she was putting an order to the till and just ignored me completely. I turned to the bar and waited for anyone to look at me and requested a glass by raising my voice: PLEASE Is anyone can pass me an empty glass? It was such an awkward situation.... After 25 minutes we finally had a possibility to enjoy our wine. Next time I tried to get a recommendation about Riesling wine which they used to have on the old drinks menu. The bartender didn't show any interest in even trying to find my taste. And there is always issues with the bar team and this particular floor - I don't understand why? General manager and restaurant manager need to look into this as I can see from the other reviews - it's happening very often. I think they are all demotivated or tired. To be honest with you, I will try to look for another good place in Canary Wharf on the top floor (didnt try any of other yet) because of this bar and team's attitude as I can't bother anymore - it always changes my mood.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r585263636-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

Except the wrong drinks were transposed, the bar staff didn't bother to print off order, waiting staff didn't bother to check that it had been started on even after a number of queries about delays and the non-alcoholic cocktails were served with alcohol. And that was after a 55 minute wait. Next round marginally better - except this time the insisted on alcohol free drink (Tequila Sunrise - without tequila) taook 45 minutes to arrive. Lovely venue but a classic case of style over substance. Beyond parody",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r580796996-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html,Tripadvisor

453,Bokan 37 Restaurant,2,"Would not touch with a 10 foot pole. Yes, the view is great (assuming you're there on a good day). But the service was painfully slow (took them 45 mins to get our food out after taking orders) and you could tell the staff would much rather be elsewhere. When the food arrived, it was... below average. Not even average. At least, that was the case for me (I had a fried salmon... it seemed like their twist on fish and chips but the flavours were not a good combo, shall we just say). Now if you asked my fiance, the response is more like ""the food was horrible"" because he got a terrible case of food poisoning that very evening, after the lunch we had there. We didn't have anything else unusual that day so that lunch at Bokan was the likeliest culprit. His food poisoning was so bad he had a fever and missed two whole days of work afterwards.

The other half said his lamb was one of the best meals he'd ever had, my cod however had to be sent back as it was stone cold and raw in the middle (I suspect from the texture it was previously frozen).

We actually visited on 19th May, which is our wedding anniversary as well as being the date of the Royal wedding. The place was absolutely buzzing with wonderful happy vibes due to the special occasion that many were there to watch on the large screens. We watched a bit and I have to say it was nothing short of spectacular to be able to watch the royal wedding with the London skyline as the back drop. They really had set things out nicely for those wanting to come along and partake in this celebration. We were made to feel extra special as it was our anniversary and every member of staff we encountered gave us their best wishes. We were seated and the views were, in my opinion, the best I have ever experienced in London. We were served by Guillaume and also the husband and wife team. They were effortlessly friendly and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. Honestly top notch staff! The food was delightful - we had the three course set menu, including the royal wedding cake. We even got a little bag of token chocolates to take with us, which was a lovely touch. The drinks flowed and we had an absolutely fantastic anniversary; and it was down to the incredible location and views, the food, the fabulous atmosphere and the amazing staff. Thank you!
