I even chose Bokan for Christmas lunch. I think I could be considered a good, if not a very loyal client. I have never pulled rank, never asked for special treatment and never got stressed out over the placement of the table. I have now planned a dinner for 6 at Bokan next month. For this one time I asked if I could reserve a table of my choice for this very special group of people to experience the restaurant. I was told very plainly and clearly ..... NO, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY! I was even told by one staff member that if I came 2 hours in advance of the dinner at 6pm I could then take the table of my choice because the place would be empty !!!! Now, I have been dining in the best restaurants in the world for about 60 years in fact long before any of the Bokan staff could even spell the word restaurant. The fact that for one time I'm not able to book a table of my choice proves several facts. 1. There is no restaurant / customer loyalty. 2. The management of the restaurant really has no idea what world class dining is about! 3. The customers of Bokan are merely a number and the place clearly caters to the transient diner with whom they need not establish a rapport or a relationship with. Considering this attitude of Bokan I will take my custom as well as my friends elsewhere. We will dine on the special evening mentioned at C. London (Cipriani) where I can book the table I feel comfortable at, where the table linens are as exquisite as the food and the white uniformed staff is smiling, courteous, and care about me ...... the customer.

So I expected the service to be top class too. However, it was very disjointed. On arrival, as a party of 4, we were not offered a drink but given the wine menu. So we selected a bottle of champagne. The waitress took our order for the champagne and the starters and main courses. She sent over the sommelier who recommended and left on the table a claret for the main course. We then waited for a while until the starters arrived whereby we had to chase up the champagne. When it finally arrived the waiter tried to take away the claret glasses until we retrieved them as we also had our claret, long before the champagne. Fortunately we had chosen cold starters. Then during the main course one of the waitresses leant right across the table to pour the jus rather than going around. The service continued rather haphazardly all evening. Overall, the view is lovely, the food is tasty and beautifully presented but the kitchen is let down by a disorganised (but friendly) waiting staff.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r731119585-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

Around 40 minutes later, we still hadn\u2019t received our drinks, never mind the food. This was despite a couple who came in after us getting both food and drinks long before us. The waiters kept walking past and looking at the table and could clearly see we didn\u2019t have any drinks yet, but did nothing about it. It wasn\u2019t until I got the attention of a female member of staff, who looked to be in charge possibly and mentioned it to her that something started to be done. It was however, an hour, before we even got our drinks and then eventually our food came out. We were charged a \u00a37.25 service charge, which seemed excessive seeing as it took so long to get anything to eat or drink. When the food arrived, it was ok but nothing special and certainly not worth the wait.

Unfortunately for us the whole terrace had been booked for the evening so we had drinks on floor 38 instead. I had only found this out this morning when the receptionist called to confirm our reservation. This was mentioned on the website but I hadn\u2019t thoroughly checked it. The guy on reception on 38 was very welcoming and perfect for front of house. The bar staff were very friendly and the guy that served our drinks at the table on 38 enjoyed conversation and a joke or two. As we were leaving to go to the restaurant I had half-jokingly asked him whether the tip we gave him included a quick sneak view of the party upstairs he became quite serious and said it was not possible. Maybe I read it wrongly but he seemed a little distant from that moment. At 7pm the restaurant had only 2-3 other tables booked and we were served quickly. Our waiter, Cristian, was a delight. Both the receptionist that called this morning and Cristian checked to see whether there were any allergies and also asked whether it was a special occasion. After choosing our mains and changing one meal there was a slight mix-up. This minor error with our meal choices would have been quickly corrected but we were happy to proceed as presented and the beef and duck choices were delicious as were the desserts. It was a slightly higher price than expected with a main, a side and a dessert each, with just one glass of wine at the table around \u00a360 per head. To me the docklands area has a slightly distant \u2018unreal\u2019 feel to it and there was less interaction with other customers in this establishment than we usually find in The City and West End. This could well change depending on the night and could also be my own personal take on the vibe.

I even chose Bokan for Christmas lunch. I think I could be considered a good, if not a very loyal client. I have never pulled rank, never asked for special treatment and never got stressed out over the placement of the table. I have now planned a dinner for 6 at Bokan next month. For this one time I asked if I could reserve a table of my choice for this very special group of people to experience the restaurant. I was told very plainly and clearly ..... NO, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY! I was even told by one staff member that if I came 2 hours in advance of the dinner at 6pm I could then take the table of my choice because the place would be empty !!!! Now, I have been dining in the best restaurants in the world for about 60 years in fact long before any of the Bokan staff could even spell the word restaurant. The fact that for one time I'm not able to book a table of my choice proves several facts. 1. There is no restaurant / customer loyalty. 2. The management of the restaurant really has no idea what world class dining is about! 3. The customers of Bokan are merely a number and the place clearly caters to the transient diner with whom they need not establish a rapport or a relationship with. Considering this attitude of Bokan I will take my custom as well as my friends elsewhere. We will dine on the special evening mentioned at C. London (Cipriani) where I can book the table I feel comfortable at, where the table linens are as exquisite as the food and the white uniformed staff is smiling, courteous, and care about me ...... the customer.

We then waited for a while until the starters arrived whereby we had to chase up the champagne. When it finally arrived the waiter tried to take away the claret glasses until we retrieved them as we also had our claret, long before the champagne. Fortunately we had chosen cold starters. Then during the main course one of the waitresses leant right across the table to pour the jus rather than going around. The service continued rather haphazardly all evening.

Unfortunately for us the whole terrace had been booked for the evening so we had drinks on floor 38 instead. I had only found this out this morning when the receptionist called to confirm our reservation. This was mentioned on the website but I hadn\u2019t thoroughly checked it. The guy on reception on 38 was very welcoming and perfect for front of house. The bar staff were very friendly and the guy that served our drinks at the table on 38 enjoyed conversation and a joke or two. As we were leaving to go to the restaurant I had half-jokingly asked him whether the tip we gave him included a quick sneak view of the party upstairs he became quite serious and said it was not possible. Maybe I read it wrongly but he seemed a little distant from that moment. At 7pm the restaurant had only 2-3 other tables booked and we were served quickly. Our waiter, Cristian, was a delight. Both the receptionist that called this morning and Cristian checked to see whether there were any allergies and also asked whether it was a special occasion. After choosing our mains and changing one meal there was a slight mix-up. This minor error with our meal choices would have been quickly corrected but we were happy to proceed as presented and the beef and duck choices were delicious as were the desserts. It was a slightly higher price than expected with a main, a side and a dessert each, with just one glass of wine at the table around \u00a360 per head. To me the docklands area has a slightly distant \u2018unreal\u2019 feel to it and there was less interaction with other customers in this establishment than we usually find in The City and West End. This could well change depending on the night and could also be my own personal take on the vibe. I personally love the established feel about more historic areas in London.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r688789999-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

Likewise, the waiters were unable to explain certain items on the dinner menu, i.e. what they were or how they were prepared. Everything took an absolutely extraordinary amount of time to arrive.

We watched a bit and I have to say it was nothing short of spectacular to be able to watch the royal wedding with the London skyline as the back drop. They really had set things out nicely for those wanting to come along and partake in this celebration. We were made to feel extra special as it was our anniversary and every member of staff we encountered gave us their best wishes. We were seated and the views were, in my opinion, the best I have ever experienced in London. We were served by Guillaume and also the husband and wife team. They were effortlessly friendly and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. Honestly top notch staff! The food was delightful - we had the three course set menu, including the royal wedding cake. We even got a little bag of token chocolates to take with us, which was a lovely touch.

We always walk-in and very kind reception ladies try to accommodate and find a table for you. 6 of us went to the restaurant a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time - bill was \u00a3500 but we had great food, amazing wine. However, let me tell one very important thing - bar team and waitress are always rude (not restaurant's). I never complained to any of the managers but I cannot hide it anymore. The last time I went there - we were 3 ladies and ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress brought 2 glasses only but and I kindly asked to get 1 more glass (obviously). We waited for 15 minutes but there was no one and still didnt get the glass. I went to the bar, no one paid any attention. Then I found the same waitress and again KINDLY asked to get an empty glass because we are 3. She was so arrogant and started to show her embarrassment by saying: \"I told you that I'm bringing it.\" I cannot believe.. I said I cant wait any longer because it has been more than 15 minutes! Then she was putting an order to the till and just ignored me completely. I turned to the bar and waited for anyone to look at me and requested a glass by raising my voice: PLEASE Is anyone can pass me an empty glass? It was such an awkward situation.... After 25 minutes we finally had a possibility to enjoy our wine. Next time I tried to get a recommendation about Riesling wine which they used to have on the old drinks menu. The bartender didn't show any interest in even trying to find my taste. And there is always issues with the bar team and this particular floor - I don't understand why? General manager and restaurant manager need to look into this as I can see from the other reviews - it's happening very often. I think they are all demotivated or tired. To be honest with you, I will try to look for another good place in Canary Wharf on the top floor (didnt try any of other yet) because of this bar and team's attitude as I can't bother anymore - it always changes my mood.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r585263636-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

When the food arrived, it was... below average. Not even average. At least, that was the case for me (I had a fried salmon... it seemed like their twist on fish and chips but the flavours were not a good combo, shall we just say). Now if you asked my fiance, the response is more like \"the food was horrible\" because he got a terrible case of food poisoning that very evening, after the lunch we had there. We didn't have anything else unusual that day so that lunch at Bokan was the likeliest culprit. His food poisoning was so bad he had a fever and missed two whole days of work afterwards.

I would have expected the waiter to be more clued up on allergens and to be more helpful. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a cheap restaurant. When my steak came the meat was cooked medium rare as requested but it wasn\u2019t a good piece of meat and was quite chewy.

Something had been excluded from the dish due to my gluten intolerance but that had not been pointed out when I ordered. So, great that it was omitted however this should have been mentioned at the time of ordering. The \u201cAmuse Bouche\u201d was just brought to me and I had to request the waiter check the ingredients before I had it - again disappointing.

You enter the building prime time on a Saturday afternoon and expect to see someone on the podium of the entrance but there isn't. So you have to work out for yourself how to use the lift and which floor you need to go to. We ended up in the bar, but the woman at reception couldn't understand a word we was saying. Despite us being locals. She thought we was wanting to book a table, despite us repeatedly saying \"we are here for our 2pm booking\". Then we was seated in the bar area at a table that was practically on the floor. I asked to be moved to a table where we wouldnt have to eat with our food on our laps. He then gave us a bar menu. We asked if we could have the brunch menu which we booked for. He said this was downstairs but the brunch was now over. I advised I had checked online and that I was sure the last SEATING for brunch was 2pm and it started at 12. However it get very confusing as he couldn't really understand what we was saying either. We were just about to leave when we checked to say are you sure we cannot have a table and he said that we could but we had to order as the kitchen takes the last orders for brunch at 2:30pm. Finally when we got around it all we had a table booked downstairs and we were able to enjoy the meal however, it was a lot of stress for us.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r558603304-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

One of our group does not drink so she was given an option to choose a Mock-tail instead. Overall the food was tastey and very satisfying.

I have NO regret for booking this hotel. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it for sure. The only \"negative\" comment I had read about the hotel was the very slow service at the bar or the restaurant. OMG, beyond SLOW.......staff walked by me and totally ignored me and my friend. I even stood at the bar wanting a glass of wine, was standing right in front of the bartender who was YES I KNOW very busy, but he could have at least acknowledge my presence......It took for ever to get a glass of wine, and than had to ask for my check......Having said that the staff for the brunch if wonderful and if this obvious they are there to serve you and make sure your visit is as enjoyable as possible. Another comment, is that there doesn't seem to be enough tables on the 3 floors to accommodate the number of guests staying at the hotel. Also, there was NO information in the room for phone numbers such as room service, front desk, wakeup call, etc....and no visitor guide or magazine. I do have to say that these are minor issues and the hotel still deserves a 4.9 stars our of five.........", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r507234778-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

We were having a great time before this and would have easily stayed in there until closing, and spent a lot more money, but this made us want to leave straight away. The gentlemen could have come over to make sure we was good if he had a concern, or seen if we needed anything, but it felt like because security said something to him, he came over as the man, and told us to calm down.

We were certainly not disappointed, they are really really superb. As the bar has floor to ceiling windows, you get a spectacular view of central London.

Unfortunetly, the service is dreadful. I have never come across such rude staff anywhere in London. My colleague's birthday drinks were totally ruined. The hostess on level 38 was abrupt with no customer skills. I was made feel unwelcome. Bar staff on level 39 were even worse. On several occasions when trying to buy a drink I was totally ignored. After waiting for some time I was told I had to queue somewhere else. No further details were given or explained to me. Buying a drink each time was such a challenge. Settling payments was another issue - each time different prices were applied for the same drink. A tall waiter kept coming to our area throughout the night reminding us how we should have booked a table, despite half of the reserved ones being empty. I don't understand why would you want to turn spending clients away when the place is half empty. The overall experience was very disappointing. As an employee based in Canary Wharf, I was very excited about the opening of this venue. I thought it would be great for team outings, Friday drinks, leaving parties, etc. There is no way I'm coming backing to Bokan and will not recommend to it to anyone in Canary Wharf.

Very impressive views out over Canary Wharf, the interior has been well designed and the view from the men's loos is something else (we all made a point of going for a look). However we waited an hour for our starters to arrive and thought they were nice it wasn't worth an hour's wait. The chef clearly was struggling and sent an amouse bouche to keep us occupied but we had to ask for bread which should have come as standard. The mains were nice but I was certainly not going to leave feeling stuffed. Slight style over substance and for the price I would expect more of a complete plate of food.

The ginger pudding was full of flavour and melted in the mouth. My fellow Diner commentated that it was the best dessert they had had in 20 years.

There was a warm welcome on arrival and we were taken to a high table in the bar. I asked the person who showed us to the table if the food came from the same kitchen in the bar and the restaurant but she said it was a better menu in the restaurant, which I expected. Then she said that they had had a cancellation in the restaurant so could move us to there, which we were very happy about. Our table was right next to the window and the view was fabulous. The decor inside the restaurant and bar is very industrial, with big windows really making the best of the view. The only issue we had was the music. It was kind of annoying and it would have been nice to have something a bit more mellow to enhance the sophisticated atmosphere. We selected a very nice bottle of portuguese red and looked at the menu. Some excellent bread was brought to the table. The menu wasn't huge but we both found things we wanted to try. For starter we shared the Bokan board which had a selection of charcuterie, cheese, pate and a scotch egg. The pate lacked a bit of flavour but the scotch egg was perfectly cooked with a runny centre. For main we had the pork belly and venison pie, both were very tasty. The desserts were also very good and beautifully presented, plus good coffee to finish. The service throughout was charming, friendly and helpful. Overall we had a lovely evening. The full price of the meal would be a little high but this is definitely a place to come for a special occasion.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r467983973-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

I have never pulled rank, never asked for special treatment and never got stressed out over the placement of the table. I have now planned a dinner for 6 at Bokan next month. For this one time I asked if I could reserve a table of my choice for this very special group of people to experience the restaurant. I was told very plainly and clearly ..... NO, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY! I was even told by one staff member that if I came 2 hours in advance of the dinner at 6pm I could then take the table of my choice because the place would be empty !!!! Now, I have been dining in the best restaurants in the world for about 60 years in fact long before any of the Bokan staff could even spell the word restaurant. The fact that for one time I'm not able to book a table of my choice proves several facts. 1. There is no restaurant / customer loyalty. 2. The management of the restaurant really has no idea what world class dining is about! 3. The customers of Bokan are merely a number and the place clearly caters to the transient diner with whom they need not establish a rapport or a relationship with. Considering this attitude of Bokan I will take my custom as well as my friends elsewhere. We will dine on the special evening mentioned at C. London (Cipriani) where I can book the table I feel comfortable at, where the table linens are as exquisite as the food and the white uniformed staff is smiling, courteous, and care about me ...... the customer. Goodbye Bokan. Your mediocre service will not take you far. By the way, The Ivy In The Park is also a wonderful restaurant that cares about their clients.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r743086109-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

So I expected the service to be top class too. However, it was very disjointed. On arrival, as a party of 4, we were not offered a drink but given the wine menu. So we selected a bottle of champagne. The waitress took our order for the champagne and the starters and main courses. She sent over the sommelier who recommended and left on the table a claret for the main course. We then waited for a while until the starters arrived whereby we had to chase up the champagne. When it finally arrived the waiter tried to take away the claret glasses until we retrieved them as we also had our claret, long before the champagne. Fortunately we had chosen cold starters. Then during the main course one of the waitresses leant right across the table to pour the jus rather than going around. The service continued rather haphazardly all evening. Overall, the view is lovely, the food is tasty and beautifully presented but the kitchen is let down by a disorganised (but friendly) waiting staff.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r731119585-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

We were sat 15 minutes after time allotted but was no issue as we had a drink in bar.

Around 40 minutes later, we still hadn\u2019t received our drinks, never mind the food. This was despite a couple who came in after us getting both food and drinks long before us. The waiters kept walking past and looking at the table and could clearly see we didn\u2019t have any drinks yet, but did nothing about it. It wasn\u2019t until I got the attention of a female member of staff, who looked to be in charge possibly and mentioned it to her that something started to be done. It was however, an hour, before we even got our drinks and then eventually our food came out. We were charged a \u00a37.25 service charge, which seemed excessive seeing as it took so long to get anything to eat or drink. When the food arrived, it was ok but nothing special and certainly not worth the wait.

Unfortunately for us the whole terrace had been booked for the evening so we had drinks on floor 38 instead. I had only found this out this morning when the receptionist called to confirm our reservation. This was mentioned on the website but I hadn\u2019t thoroughly checked it. The guy on reception on 38 was very welcoming and perfect for front of house. The bar staff were very friendly and the guy that served our drinks at the table on 38 enjoyed conversation and a joke or two. As we were leaving to go to the restaurant I had half-jokingly asked him whether the tip we gave him included a quick sneak view of the party upstairs he became quite serious and said it was not possible. Maybe I read it wrongly but he seemed a little distant from that moment. At 7pm the restaurant had only 2-3 other tables booked and we were served quickly. Our waiter, Cristian, was a delight. Both the receptionist that called this morning and Cristian checked to see whether there were any allergies and also asked whether it was a special occasion. After choosing our mains and changing one meal there was a slight mix-up. This minor error with our meal choices would have been quickly corrected but we were happy to proceed as presented and the beef and duck choices were delicious as were the desserts. It was a slightly higher price than expected with a main, a side and a dessert each, with just one glass of wine at the table around \u00a360 per head. To me the docklands area has a slightly distant \u2018unreal\u2019 feel to it and there was less interaction with other customers in this establishment than we usually find in The City and West End. This could well change depending on the night and could also be my own personal take on the vibe.

While the food was generally very good and well presented on the plate, the service was absolutely terrible. The staff was not trained and inattentive. When we asked for the cocktail list, it took forever to arrive, and the waiter could not explain the cocktails and had to get another member of the bar staff. The same happened with the wine menu. Likewise, the waiters were unable to explain certain items on the dinner menu, i.e. what they were or how they were prepared. Everything took an absolutely extraordinary amount of time to arrive. We had endless wait times between courses and long periods with empty drinks. It was very hard to track down the waiters for anything, and we had to physically get up twice to grab one to place an order.

The place was absolutely buzzing with wonderful happy vibes due to the special occasion that many were there to watch on the large screens. We watched a bit and I have to say it was nothing short of spectacular to be able to watch the royal wedding with the London skyline as the back drop. They really had set things out nicely for those wanting to come along and partake in this celebration. We were made to feel extra special as it was our anniversary and every member of staff we encountered gave us their best wishes. We were seated and the views were, in my opinion, the best I have ever experienced in London. We were served by Guillaume and also the husband and wife team. They were effortlessly friendly and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. Honestly top notch staff! The food was delightful - we had the three course set menu, including the royal wedding cake. We even got a little bag of token chocolates to take with us, which was a lovely touch. The drinks flowed and we had an absolutely fantastic anniversary; and it was down to the incredible location and views, the food, the fabulous atmosphere and the amazing staff. Thank you!

We started with drinks on the roof terrace on the 38th floor which is amazing, especially as it was a clear, sunny evening. The atmosphere is fun and lively and of course the view is breathtaking. We had the Tasting Menu with paired wines and enjoyed every mouthful with special mention for the Salmon with mint & pea velout\u00e9. Service was good with friendly young staff and, although it was busy, it was still possible to hold a conversation across the table. We were there quite a long time and enjoyed every minute.

Yes, the view is great (assuming you're there on a good day). But the service was painfully slow (took them 45 mins to get our food out after taking orders) and you could tell the staff would much rather be elsewhere. When the food arrived, it was... below average. Not even average. At least, that was the case for me (I had a fried salmon... it seemed like their twist on fish and chips but the flavours were not a good combo, shall we just say). Now if you asked my fiance, the response is more like \"the food was horrible\" because he got a terrible case of food poisoning that very evening, after the lunch we had there. We didn't have anything else unusual that day so that lunch at Bokan was the likeliest culprit. His food poisoning was so bad he had a fever and missed two whole days of work afterwards.

We always walk-in and very kind reception ladies try to accommodate and find a table for you. 6 of us went to the restaurant a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time - bill was \u00a3500 but we had great food, amazing wine. However, let me tell one very important thing - bar team and waitress are always rude (not restaurant's). I never complained to any of the managers but I cannot hide it anymore. The last time I went there - we were 3 ladies and ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress brought 2 glasses only but and I kindly asked to get 1 more glass (obviously). We waited for 15 minutes but there was no one and still didnt get the glass. I went to the bar, no one paid any attention. Then I found the same waitress and again KINDLY asked to get an empty glass because we are 3. She was so arrogant and started to show her embarrassment by saying: \"I told you that I'm bringing it.\" I cannot believe.. I said I cant wait any longer because it has been more than 15 minutes! Then she was putting an order to the till and just ignored me completely. I turned to the bar and waited for anyone to look at me and requested a glass by raising my voice: PLEASE Is anyone can pass me an empty glass? It was such an awkward situation.... After 25 minutes we finally had a possibility to enjoy our wine. Next time I tried to get a recommendation about Riesling wine which they used to have on the old drinks menu. The bartender didn't show any interest in even trying to find my taste. And there is always issues with the bar team and this particular floor - I don't understand why? General manager and restaurant manager need to look into this as I can see from the other reviews - it's happening very often. I think they are all demotivated or tired. To be honest with you, I will try to look for another good place in Canary Wharf on the top floor (didnt try any of other yet) because of this bar and team's attitude as I can't bother anymore - it always changes my mood.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r585263636-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

I was greeted and shown to a table and although initially service was attentive I was not given guidance on allergens in the menu and I had to try ordering a few options until I got one I could have. I would have expected the waiter to be more clued up on allergens and to be more helpful. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a cheap restaurant. When my steak came the meat was cooked medium rare as requested but it wasn\u2019t a good piece of meat and was quite chewy. I\u2019m from a farming family so I know good steak and that wasn\u2019t the quality I\u2019d expect at a restaurant of this calibre. Something had been excluded from the dish due to my gluten intolerance but that had not been pointed out when I ordered. So, great that it was omitted however this should have been mentioned at the time of ordering. The \u201cAmuse Bouche\u201d was just brought to me and I had to request the waiter check the ingredients before I had it - again disappointing. I actually felt like I was a pain to the servers because of my allergies and other tables seemed to get more attentive service as I was sat there with an empty glass for ages and being ignored.

You walk in early and surprise surprise, everything is already booked for the day!

Another comment, is that there doesn't seem to be enough tables on the 3 floors to accommodate the number of guests staying at the hotel.

There were only 3 of us, and the staff seem friendly, the drinks kept coming, and we was having a great time. My friend accidentally knocked a drink over, and within 2 minutes the manager came over and said that security was watching us and to calm down. (Knocking the drink over may have been coincidence). We were having a great time before this and would have easily stayed in there until closing, and spent a lot more money, but this made us want to leave straight away. The gentlemen could have come over to make sure we was good if he had a concern, or seen if we needed anything, but it felt like because security said something to him, he came over as the man, and told us to calm down. It put us off and I don't think we will be going back. There are enough rooftop bars in London, which are cheaper as well, and you won't get accused of anything either.

The starters were magnificent, such intense and amazing flavours. When the main course came none of us were disappointed. The steak, fish and chicken dishes were cooked to perfection and accompanied with eye catching pur\u00e9es and foams that were packed with complimentary flavours. The wine was great, also full of flavour but not overbearing - just right! It seemed a shame to stop at the main course...the puddings and cheeses matched the quality and flavours we had already experienced and the sommelier picked us a wonderful wine to finish.

Avoid, it's not as good as the staff think they they are.....We were there last night and the entire staff force were some of the rudest people we have ever had the misfortune to be \"served\" by. At the door the front of house had the snottiness attitude and was not the least bit welcoming. The bar staff had unwarranted attitude and were argumentative at every opportunity irrespective of the amount of money we were spending. They had the utter nerve to keep changing the prices of our drinks because the menus were in the \"process of being updated\"! Here's a tip, update the menus and THEN put them on the tables! Don't tell your staff to come up with rough numbers and then get aggressive when we state our basic consumer rights.... Unfortunately we have to return here in a few weeks for a corporate event.

Firstly the lady on the door didn't want us in the bar. We turned up early as booking an area for 2 hours was \u00a3600! She said if we could find a table then we could sit at it but she didn't like the idea of 20 people and not sure why as we all have jobs and money! It took a man in our party to get a table for us and then she gave me dirty looks all night. The last straw was the prices advertised on the menu were not what we were charged. The prosecco was \u00a310 more! Also they add 20% to your bill when you buy from the bar! Surely this is not legal!

It certainly didn't disappoint. Our table was booked for 7.15pm and we were promptly walked to out table. A cloudy day, and what could have dampened the view , soon changed to sun streaming through the cloud to highlight The Shaard and Millenium Wheel, sites we were able to see from our seats at the window table. Although the table had a 2 hour rebooking slot, something made clear in the booking, we were not made to feel as though we had to rush off or that someone was waiting for the table. As for the food. Well this has to be some of the best I have tasted in a while. From the 'amuse-Boucher ' to the main course of fillet steak, all tasted amazing. Will definitely be going back. Will have to just make up a special occasion to justify the visit. The icing on the proverbial cake has to be the roof terrace. The views from here, once evening had taken hold, were amazing. Being a little chilly that evening meant we couldn't spend as much time out there as we would have hoped but in the summer, provided it's not too British, this will be the only place you will want to be.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r486580838-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

There was a warm welcome on arrival and we were taken to a high table in the bar. I asked the person who showed us to the table if the food came from the same kitchen in the bar and the restaurant but she said it was a better menu in the restaurant, which I expected. Then she said that they had had a cancellation in the restaurant so could move us to there, which we were very happy about. Our table was right next to the window and the view was fabulous. The decor inside the restaurant and bar is very industrial, with big windows really making the best of the view. The only issue we had was the music. It was kind of annoying and it would have been nice to have something a bit more mellow to enhance the sophisticated atmosphere. We selected a very nice bottle of portuguese red and looked at the menu. Some excellent bread was brought to the table. The menu wasn't huge but we both found things we wanted to try. For starter we shared the Bokan board which had a selection of charcuterie, cheese, pate and a scotch egg. The pate lacked a bit of flavour but the scotch egg was perfectly cooked with a runny centre. For main we had the pork belly and venison pie, both were very tasty. The desserts were also very good and beautifully presented, plus good coffee to finish. The service throughout was charming, friendly and helpful. Overall we had a lovely evening. The full price of the meal would be a little high but this is definitely a place to come for a special occasion.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r467983973-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

I even chose Bokan for Christmas lunch. I think I could be considered a good, if not a very loyal client. I have never pulled rank, never asked for special treatment and never got stressed out over the placement of the table. I have now planned a dinner for 6 at Bokan next month. For this one time I asked if I could reserve a table of my choice for this very special group of people to experience the restaurant. I was told very plainly and clearly ..... NO, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY! I was even told by one staff member that if I came 2 hours in advance of the dinner at 6pm I could then take the table of my choice because the place would be empty !!!! Now, I have been dining in the best restaurants in the world for about 60 years in fact long before any of the Bokan staff could even spell the word restaurant. The fact that for one time I'm not able to book a table of my choice proves several facts. 1. There is no restaurant / customer loyalty. 2. The management of the restaurant really has no idea what world class dining is about! 3. The customers of Bokan are merely a number and the place clearly caters to the transient diner with whom they need not establish a rapport or a relationship with. Considering this attitude of Bokan I will take my custom as well as my friends elsewhere. We will dine on the special evening mentioned at C. London (Cipriani) where I can book the table I feel comfortable at, where the table linens are as exquisite as the food and the white uniformed staff is smiling, courteous, and care about me ...... the customer.

So I expected the service to be top class too. However, it was very disjointed. On arrival, as a party of 4, we were not offered a drink but given the wine menu. So we selected a bottle of champagne. The waitress took our order for the champagne and the starters and main courses. She sent over the sommelier who recommended and left on the table a claret for the main course. We then waited for a while until the starters arrived whereby we had to chase up the champagne. When it finally arrived the waiter tried to take away the claret glasses until we retrieved them as we also had our claret, long before the champagne. Fortunately we had chosen cold starters. Then during the main course one of the waitresses leant right across the table to pour the jus rather than going around. The service continued rather haphazardly all evening. Overall, the view is lovely, the food is tasty and beautifully presented but the kitchen is let down by a disorganised (but friendly) waiting staff.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r731119585-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

You might have seen this restaurant featured on Celebrity Masterchef recently and it lived up to the exceptionally high standard of providing quality food and service. We had the bottomless prosecco brunch and not once did we need to ask to be topped up. We were given a table with a five star view of the city of London, really beautiful. For starters I had salmon with steamed hen eggs and it was absolutely delicious. My wife had a tuna starter which she loved. The next course was sirloin cooked to tender perfection on the Josper grill. Fabulous. The plum dessert didn't disappoint either. The service was excellent and we would highly recommend this restaurant for brunch on a sunny day.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r711891680-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

Around 40 minutes later, we still hadn\u2019t received our drinks, never mind the food. This was despite a couple who came in after us getting both food and drinks long before us. The waiters kept walking past and looking at the table and could clearly see we didn\u2019t have any drinks yet, but did nothing about it. It wasn\u2019t until I got the attention of a female member of staff, who looked to be in charge possibly and mentioned it to her that something started to be done. It was however, an hour, before we even got our drinks and then eventually our food came out. We were charged a \u00a37.25 service charge, which seemed excessive seeing as it took so long to get anything to eat or drink. When the food arrived, it was ok but nothing special and certainly not worth the wait.

Unfortunately for us the whole terrace had been booked for the evening so we had drinks on floor 38 instead. I had only found this out this morning when the receptionist called to confirm our reservation. This was mentioned on the website but I hadn\u2019t thoroughly checked it. The guy on reception on 38 was very welcoming and perfect for front of house. The bar staff were very friendly and the guy that served our drinks at the table on 38 enjoyed conversation and a joke or two. As we were leaving to go to the restaurant I had half-jokingly asked him whether the tip we gave him included a quick sneak view of the party upstairs he became quite serious and said it was not possible. Maybe I read it wrongly but he seemed a little distant from that moment. At 7pm the restaurant had only 2-3 other tables booked and we were served quickly. Our waiter, Cristian, was a delight. Both the receptionist that called this morning and Cristian checked to see whether there were any allergies and also asked whether it was a special occasion. After choosing our mains and changing one meal there was a slight mix-up. This minor error with our meal choices would have been quickly corrected but we were happy to proceed as presented and the beef and duck choices were delicious as were the desserts. It was a slightly higher price than expected with a main, a side and a dessert each, with just one glass of wine at the table around \u00a360 per head. To me the docklands area has a slightly distant \u2018unreal\u2019 feel to it and there was less interaction with other customers in this establishment than we usually find in The City and West End. This could well change depending on the night and could also be my own personal take on the vibe.

The place was absolutely buzzing with wonderful happy vibes due to the special occasion that many were there to watch on the large screens. We watched a bit and I have to say it was nothing short of spectacular to be able to watch the royal wedding with the London skyline as the back drop. They really had set things out nicely for those wanting to come along and partake in this celebration. We were made to feel extra special as it was our anniversary and every member of staff we encountered gave us their best wishes. We were seated and the views were, in my opinion, the best I have ever experienced in London. We were served by Guillaume and also the husband and wife team. They were effortlessly friendly and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. Honestly top notch staff! The food was delightful - we had the three course set menu, including the royal wedding cake. We even got a little bag of token chocolates to take with us, which was a lovely touch. The drinks flowed and we had an absolutely fantastic anniversary; and it was down to the incredible location and views, the food, the fabulous atmosphere and the amazing staff. Thank you!

There's a bar on one floor, and restaurant below. The menu is compact (I've been there 3 times in 3 months and the menu is the same). The chef favours undercooked fish, but will cook meat to your taste. The vegetarian options are tasty and include cheese, but I think a vegan may struggle to find something unless the restaurant is advised in advance.

We always walk-in and very kind reception ladies try to accommodate and find a table for you. 6 of us went to the restaurant a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time - bill was \u00a3500 but we had great food, amazing wine. However, let me tell one very important thing - bar team and waitress are always rude (not restaurant's). I never complained to any of the managers but I cannot hide it anymore. The last time I went there - we were 3 ladies and ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress brought 2 glasses only but and I kindly asked to get 1 more glass (obviously). We waited for 15 minutes but there was no one and still didnt get the glass. I went to the bar, no one paid any attention. Then I found the same waitress and again KINDLY asked to get an empty glass because we are 3. She was so arrogant and started to show her embarrassment by saying: \"I told you that I'm bringing it.\" I cannot believe.. I said I cant wait any longer because it has been more than 15 minutes! Then she was putting an order to the till and just ignored me completely. I turned to the bar and waited for anyone to look at me and requested a glass by raising my voice: PLEASE Is anyone can pass me an empty glass? It was such an awkward situation.... After 25 minutes we finally had a possibility to enjoy our wine. Next time I tried to get a recommendation about Riesling wine which they used to have on the old drinks menu. The bartender didn't show any interest in even trying to find my taste. And there is always issues with the bar team and this particular floor - I don't understand why? General manager and restaurant manager need to look into this as I can see from the other reviews - it's happening very often. I think they are all demotivated or tired. To be honest with you, I will try to look for another good place in Canary Wharf on the top floor (didnt try any of other yet) because of this bar and team's attitude as I can't bother anymore - it always changes my mood.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r585263636-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

When the food arrived, it was... below average. Not even average. At least, that was the case for me (I had a fried salmon... it seemed like their twist on fish and chips but the flavours were not a good combo, shall we just say). Now if you asked my fiance, the response is more like \"the food was horrible\" because he got a terrible case of food poisoning that very evening, after the lunch we had there. We didn't have anything else unusual that day so that lunch at Bokan was the likeliest culprit. His food poisoning was so bad he had a fever and missed two whole days of work afterwards.

I\u2019ve never eaten food with so much flavour before, it was totally worth the money. And the service was amazing, every member of staff made us feel so welcome. Not to mention my friend was given a birthday treat with a selection of mini desserts and a little pastry/ cake to go.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r570055197-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

I stated I had food intolerances upon booking and this was noted. I was greeted and shown to a table and although initially service was attentive I was not given guidance on allergens in the menu and I had to try ordering a few options until I got one I could have. I would have expected the waiter to be more clued up on allergens and to be more helpful. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a cheap restaurant. When my steak came the meat was cooked medium rare as requested but it wasn\u2019t a good piece of meat and was quite chewy. I\u2019m from a farming family so I know good steak and that wasn\u2019t the quality I\u2019d expect at a restaurant of this calibre. Something had been excluded from the dish due to my gluten intolerance but that had not been pointed out when I ordered. So, great that it was omitted however this should have been mentioned at the time of ordering. The \u201cAmuse Bouche\u201d was just brought to me and I had to request the waiter check the ingredients before I had it - again disappointing. I actually felt like I was a pain to the servers because of my allergies and other tables seemed to get more attentive service as I was sat there with an empty glass for ages and being ignored. All in all, great views, nice wine list but below par steak and below par service - specifically around allergens.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r565330501-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

Another comment, is that there doesn't seem to be enough tables on the 3 floors to accommodate the number of guests staying at the hotel. Also, there was NO information in the room for phone numbers such as room service, front desk, wakeup call, etc....and no visitor guide or magazine.

We were certainly not disappointed, they are really really superb. As the bar has floor to ceiling windows, you get a spectacular view of central London. Luke who served us in the evening was also very nice and very friendly, he even made a bespoke cocktail for my friend. Jeevan who is the manager there came and checked on us often. To be fair we were there from 4.30pm - 1am, but even still it was very nice to be checked upon and so looked after by Jeevan. He also gave us a show around of the restaurant and the roof top bar. We will definitely return. The only small feedback would have is to change the olives in the bar, they really did not taste good, they were almost bitter.

After waiting for some time I was told I had to queue somewhere else. No further details were given or explained to me. Buying a drink each time was such a challenge. Settling payments was another issue - each time different prices were applied for the same drink. A tall waiter kept coming to our area throughout the night reminding us how we should have booked a table, despite half of the reserved ones being empty. I don't understand why would you want to turn spending clients away when the place is half empty. The overall experience was very disappointing. As an employee based in Canary Wharf, I was very excited about the opening of this venue. I thought it would be great for team outings, Friday drinks, leaving parties, etc. There is no way I'm coming backing to Bokan and will not recommend to it to anyone in Canary Wharf.

It certainly didn't disappoint. Our table was booked for 7.15pm and we were promptly walked to out table. A cloudy day, and what could have dampened the view , soon changed to sun streaming through the cloud to highlight The Shaard and Millenium Wheel, sites we were able to see from our seats at the window table. Although the table had a 2 hour rebooking slot, something made clear in the booking, we were not made to feel as though we had to rush off or that someone was waiting for the table. As for the food. Well this has to be some of the best I have tasted in a while. From the 'amuse-Boucher ' to the main course of fillet steak, all tasted amazing. Will definitely be going back. Will have to just make up a special occasion to justify the visit. The icing on the proverbial cake has to be the roof terrace. The views from here, once evening had taken hold, were amazing. Being a little chilly that evening meant we couldn't spend as much time out there as we would have hoped but in the summer, provided it's not too British, this will be the only place you will want to be.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r486580838-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

There was a warm welcome on arrival and we were taken to a high table in the bar. I asked the person who showed us to the table if the food came from the same kitchen in the bar and the restaurant but she said it was a better menu in the restaurant, which I expected. Then she said that they had had a cancellation in the restaurant so could move us to there, which we were very happy about. Our table was right next to the window and the view was fabulous. The decor inside the restaurant and bar is very industrial, with big windows really making the best of the view. The only issue we had was the music. It was kind of annoying and it would have been nice to have something a bit more mellow to enhance the sophisticated atmosphere. We selected a very nice bottle of portuguese red and looked at the menu. Some excellent bread was brought to the table. The menu wasn't huge but we both found things we wanted to try. For starter we shared the Bokan board which had a selection of charcuterie, cheese, pate and a scotch egg. The pate lacked a bit of flavour but the scotch egg was perfectly cooked with a runny centre. For main we had the pork belly and venison pie, both were very tasty. The desserts were also very good and beautifully presented, plus good coffee to finish. The service throughout was charming, friendly and helpful. Overall we had a lovely evening.

I even chose Bokan for Christmas lunch. I think I could be considered a good, if not a very loyal client. I have never pulled rank, never asked for special treatment and never got stressed out over the placement of the table. I have now planned a dinner for 6 at Bokan next month. For this one time I asked if I could reserve a table of my choice for this very special group of people to experience the restaurant. I was told very plainly and clearly ..... NO, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY! I was even told by one staff member that if I came 2 hours in advance of the dinner at 6pm I could then take the table of my choice because the place would be empty !!!! Now, I have been dining in the best restaurants in the world for about 60 years in fact long before any of the Bokan staff could even spell the word restaurant. The fact that for one time I'm not able to book a table of my choice proves several facts. 1. There is no restaurant / customer loyalty. 2. The management of the restaurant really has no idea what world class dining is about! 3. The customers of Bokan are merely a number and the place clearly caters to the transient diner with whom they need not establish a rapport or a relationship with. Considering this attitude of Bokan I will take my custom as well as my friends elsewhere. We will dine on the special evening mentioned at C. London (Cipriani) where I can book the table I feel comfortable at, where the table linens are as exquisite as the food and the white uniformed staff is smiling, courteous, and care about me ...... the customer.

The waitress took our order for the champagne and the starters and main courses. She sent over the sommelier who recommended and left on the table a claret for the main course. We then waited for a while until the starters arrived whereby we had to chase up the champagne. When it finally arrived the waiter tried to take away the claret glasses until we retrieved them as we also had our claret, long before the champagne. Fortunately we had chosen cold starters. Then during the main course one of the waitresses leant right across the table to pour the jus rather than going around. The service continued rather haphazardly all evening.

Around 40 minutes later, we still hadn\u2019t received our drinks, never mind the food. This was despite a couple who came in after us getting both food and drinks long before us. The waiters kept walking past and looking at the table and could clearly see we didn\u2019t have any drinks yet, but did nothing about it. It wasn\u2019t until I got the attention of a female member of staff, who looked to be in charge possibly and mentioned it to her that something started to be done. It was however, an hour, before we even got our drinks and then eventually our food came out. We were charged a \u00a37.25 service charge, which seemed excessive seeing as it took so long to get anything to eat or drink. When the food arrived, it was ok but nothing special and certainly not worth the wait. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place, we certainly weren\u2019t made to feel very welcome and nothing was offered as an apology for the poor service.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r709002464-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

{"resto": "Bokan 37 Restaurant", "review_date": "11 July 2019", "review_rating": "4", "review_title": "Couldn't get to the roof terrace...", "review_text": "A week or so ago I booked a table at the restaurant on 37 and was hoping to have a drink on the roof terrace on 39 on this wonderful warm evening. Unfortunately for us the whole terrace had been booked for the evening so we had drinks on floor 38 instead. I had only found this out this morning when the receptionist called to confirm our reservation. This was mentioned on the website but I hadn\u2019t thoroughly checked it. The guy on reception on 38 was very welcoming and perfect for front of house. The bar staff were very friendly and the guy that served our drinks at the table on 38 enjoyed conversation and a joke or two. As we were leaving to go to the restaurant I had half-jokingly asked him whether the tip we gave him included a quick sneak view of the party upstairs he became quite serious and said it was not possible. Maybe I read it wrongly but he seemed a little distant from that moment. At 7pm the restaurant had only 2-3 other tables booked and we were served quickly. Our waiter, Cristian, was a delight. Both the receptionist that called this morning and Cristian checked to see whether there were any allergies and also asked whether it was a special occasion. After choosing our mains and changing one meal there was a slight mix-up. This minor error with our meal choices would have been quickly corrected but we were happy to proceed as presented and the beef and duck choices were delicious as were the desserts. It was a slightly higher price than expected with a main, a side and a dessert each, with just one glass of wine at the table around \u00a360 per head. To me the docklands area has a slightly distant \u2018unreal\u2019 feel to it and there was less interaction with other customers in this establishment than we usually find in The City and West End. This could well change depending on the night and could also be my own personal take on the vibe. I personally love the established feel about more historic areas in London.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r688789999-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

Thank you!", "review_text": "I have been meaning to write this review since our visit to Bokan. We actually visited on 19th May, which is our wedding anniversary as well as being the date of the Royal wedding. The place was absolutely buzzing with wonderful happy vibes due to the special occasion that many were there to watch on the large screens. We watched a bit and I have to say it was nothing short of spectacular to be able to watch the royal wedding with the London skyline as the back drop. They really had set things out nicely for those wanting to come along and partake in this celebration. We were made to feel extra special as it was our anniversary and every member of staff we encountered gave us their best wishes. We were seated and the views were, in my opinion, the best I have ever experienced in London. We were served by Guillaume and also the husband and wife team. They were effortlessly friendly and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. Honestly top notch staff! The food was delightful - we had the three course set menu, including the royal wedding cake. We even got a little bag of token chocolates to take with us, which was a lovely touch. The drinks flowed and we had an absolutely fantastic anniversary; and it was down to the incredible location and views, the food, the fabulous atmosphere and the amazing staff. Thank you! We will be back again for sure.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r606636091-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

We always walk-in and very kind reception ladies try to accommodate and find a table for you. 6 of us went to the restaurant a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time - bill was \u00a3500 but we had great food, amazing wine. However, let me tell one very important thing - bar team and waitress are always rude (not restaurant's). I never complained to any of the managers but I cannot hide it anymore. The last time I went there - we were 3 ladies and ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress brought 2 glasses only but and I kindly asked to get 1 more glass (obviously). We waited for 15 minutes but there was no one and still didnt get the glass. I went to the bar, no one paid any attention. Then I found the same waitress and again KINDLY asked to get an empty glass because we are 3. She was so arrogant and started to show her embarrassment by saying: \"I told you that I'm bringing it.\" I cannot believe.. I said I cant wait any longer because it has been more than 15 minutes! Then she was putting an order to the till and just ignored me completely. I turned to the bar and waited for anyone to look at me and requested a glass by raising my voice: PLEASE Is anyone can pass me an empty glass? It was such an awkward situation.... After 25 minutes we finally had a possibility to enjoy our wine. Next time I tried to get a recommendation about Riesling wine which they used to have on the old drinks menu. The bartender didn't show any interest in even trying to find my taste. And there is always issues with the bar team and this particular floor - I don't understand why? General manager and restaurant manager need to look into this as I can see from the other reviews - it's happening very often. I think they are all demotivated or tired. To be honest with you, I will try to look for another good place in Canary Wharf on the top floor (didnt try any of other yet) because of this bar and team's attitude as I can't bother anymore - it always changes my mood.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r585263636-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}

Yes, the view is great (assuming you're there on a good day). But the service was painfully slow (took them 45 mins to get our food out after taking orders) and you could tell the staff would much rather be elsewhere. When the food arrived, it was... below average. Not even average. At least, that was the case for me (I had a fried salmon... it seemed like their twist on fish and chips but the flavours were not a good combo, shall we just say). Now if you asked my fiance, the response is more like \"the food was horrible\" because he got a terrible case of food poisoning that very evening, after the lunch we had there. We didn't have anything else unusual that day so that lunch at Bokan was the likeliest culprit. His food poisoning was so bad he had a fever and missed two whole days of work afterwards.

Then we was seated in the bar area at a table that was practically on the floor. I asked to be moved to a table where we wouldnt have to eat with our food on our laps. He then gave us a bar menu. We asked if we could have the brunch menu which we booked for. He said this was downstairs but the brunch was now over. I advised I had checked online and that I was sure the last SEATING for brunch was 2pm and it started at 12. However it get very confusing as he couldn't really understand what we was saying either. We were just about to leave when we checked to say are you sure we cannot have a table and he said that we could but we had to order as the kitchen takes the last orders for brunch at 2:30pm.

I even stood at the bar wanting a glass of wine, was standing right in front of the bartender who was YES I KNOW very busy, but he could have at least acknowledge my presence......It took for ever to get a glass of wine, and than had to ask for my check......Having said that the staff for the brunch if wonderful and if this obvious they are there to serve you and make sure your visit is as enjoyable as possible. Another comment, is that there doesn't seem to be enough tables on the 3 floors to accommodate the number of guests staying at the hotel. Also, there was NO information in the room for phone numbers such as room service, front desk, wakeup call, etc....and no visitor guide or magazine.

We were certainly not disappointed, they are really really superb. As the bar has floor to ceiling windows, you get a spectacular view of central London. Luke who served us in the evening was also very nice and very friendly, he even made a bespoke cocktail for my friend. Jeevan who is the manager there came and checked on us often. To be fair we were there from 4.30pm - 1am, but even still it was very nice to be checked upon and so looked after by Jeevan. He also gave us a show around of the restaurant and the roof top bar. We will definitely return. The only small feedback would have is to change the olives in the bar, they really did not taste good, they were almost bitter. We had a great evening at Bokan and would definitely recommend to anyone to go there for a drink..friendly staff and amazing views guaranteed!!

Unfortunetly, the service is dreadful. I have never come across such rude staff anywhere in London. My colleague's birthday drinks were totally ruined. The hostess on level 38 was abrupt with no customer skills. I was made feel unwelcome. Bar staff on level 39 were even worse. On several occasions when trying to buy a drink I was totally ignored. After waiting for some time I was told I had to queue somewhere else. No further details were given or explained to me. Buying a drink each time was such a challenge. Settling payments was another issue - each time different prices were applied for the same drink. A tall waiter kept coming to our area throughout the night reminding us how we should have booked a table, despite half of the reserved ones being empty. I don't understand why would you want to turn spending clients away when the place is half empty. The overall experience was very disappointing. As an employee based in Canary Wharf, I was very excited about the opening of this venue. I thought it would be great for team outings, Friday drinks, leaving parties, etc. There is no way I'm coming backing to Bokan and will not recommend to it to anyone in Canary Wharf.

Although the table had a 2 hour rebooking slot, something made clear in the booking, we were not made to feel as though we had to rush off or that someone was waiting for the table. As for the food. Well this has to be some of the best I have tasted in a while. From the 'amuse-Boucher ' to the main course of fillet steak, all tasted amazing. Will definitely be going back. Will have to just make up a special occasion to justify the visit. The icing on the proverbial cake has to be the roof terrace. The views from here, once evening had taken hold, were amazing.

The service was that slow that my husband ended up going to the bar himself which again was a completely disorganised. Whilst he was getting the drinks, I was asked to move as the table I was told to sit at was also booked. At this point, I was pretty mad and my husband and I left shortly after our first drink.

However, we attended in a large group where we were told we had to order from a set menu. What was very odd, choices were very limited and cheaper to buy off the a la carte menu. Portions were very small (agree gourmet food has smaller portions but this was smaller than dishes served at the Dorchester, Oblix etc) and whilst they were presented well, the food was below average vs. similar restaurants and somewhat bland. Service was awful, food was served cold so some dishes were sent back and drinks took forever to serve. We ended up getting up to order from the bar itself.

The ginger pudding was full of flavour and melted in the mouth. My fellow Diner commentated that it was the best dessert they had had in 20 years. I will be back in a month to see if the issues have been ironed out and then will give a more critical review.

There was a warm welcome on arrival and we were taken to a high table in the bar. I asked the person who showed us to the table if the food came from the same kitchen in the bar and the restaurant but she said it was a better menu in the restaurant, which I expected. Then she said that they had had a cancellation in the restaurant so could move us to there, which we were very happy about. Our table was right next to the window and the view was fabulous. The decor inside the restaurant and bar is very industrial, with big windows really making the best of the view. The only issue we had was the music. It was kind of annoying and it would have been nice to have something a bit more mellow to enhance the sophisticated atmosphere. We selected a very nice bottle of portuguese red and looked at the menu. Some excellent bread was brought to the table. The menu wasn't huge but we both found things we wanted to try. For starter we shared the Bokan board which had a selection of charcuterie, cheese, pate and a scotch egg. The pate lacked a bit of flavour but the scotch egg was perfectly cooked with a runny centre. For main we had the pork belly and venison pie, both were very tasty. The desserts were also very good and beautifully presented, plus good coffee to finish. The service throughout was charming, friendly and helpful. Overall we had a lovely evening. The full price of the meal would be a little high but this is definitely a place to come for a special occasion.", "review_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12156905-r467983973-Bokan_37_Restaurant-London_England.html"}
